# Cumulative output describing all the combinations of the simulation scenarios

The graphs displayed provide a visual representation of several insecticide combinations, showing four scenarios applied for emamectin benzoate combined with chlorantraniliprole, lufenuron and spinetoram respectively. The trendlines remain quite similar for all the scenarios, which describe the rest of the combinations differing in initial allele frequencies for the r-trait, applied for these compounds of interest. From all the results obtained, it seems that the r-allele persists in the population and is not lost, or even reduced in frequency, when avermectins are used in a mixture or a rotation scheme. Indeed, even when its frequency is at 0.01, most individual simulations runs led to the increase of resistance alleles attributed to the main and partner active ingredients when both regimes were applied. In this regard no significant difference was observed between rotations and mixtures. In parallel, it is also clear that the population size rapidly reaches the original population size (300 individuals) after each insecticide application, regardless of the scenario or the strategy followed.
